# Portfolio Showcase

This is a Portfolio Showcase web application built with Vue.js. It highlights my projects, including GitHub repositories and video demonstrations of my Arduino and hardware projects. The layout displays content in a card view with a 3x3 grid arrangement for both repositories and videos.

## Features

- **Project Showcase**: Displays a list of ongoing and finished projects with links to their respective GitHub repositories.
- **Video Demonstrations**: Includes videos showing real-time demonstrations of Arduino-based projects. A preview image is displayed, and the video plays when the "Play Video" button is clicked.
- **Responsive Grid Layout**: Projects and videos are displayed in a structured, 3x3 grid format, ensuring consistent and clean UI/UX.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js**: A modern JavaScript framework for building UIs and SPAs (Single Page Applications).
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the components.
